# Lepomis gibbosus Viewer
The Pumpkinseed Fish (*Lepomis gibbosus*) is one of the many freshwater fishes native in Minneasota. For my final project for BIO-242: Vertabrae Biology, I chose to highlight this particular species and showcase the various aspects seen on fish of this type.

Please take a look at the contents in the folder titles *Demonstrations* to view screen captures of the program when ran. Otherwise, you may import the project as a Godot project and export it as an executable for your device.

Thanks for checking out this project!
