# Lepomis gibbosus Viewer
The Pumpkinseed Fish (*Lepomis gibbosus*) is one of the many freshwater fishes native to Minnesota. For my final project in BIO-242: Vertebrate Biology (Spring 2025), I chose to highlight this particular species and showcase the various aspects observed in fish of this type.

Please take a look at the contents in the folder titled *Demonstrations* to view screen captures of the program in action. Otherwise, you may import the project as a Godot project and export it as an executable for your device.

Thanks for checking out this project!
